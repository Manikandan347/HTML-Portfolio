<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Manikandan, and I am an empathetic individual who values understanding others' perspectives, 
  which helps me connect deeply with people. I hold a B.E-EIE in SRM Valliammai Engineering College, equipping me with a strong educational foundation.
  My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as Python and Java, as well as graphic design tools like Photoshop, Canva, and Adobe Express. 
  I thrive in team collaboration environments, leveraging my ability to work effectively with others. 
  My problem-solving skills demonstrate my analytical and critical thinking capabilities, allowing me to tackle challenges efficiently.</p>

<p>One of my key strengths is my initiative. I am proactive by nature and constantly seek opportunities for improvement,
  implementing effective solutions to enhance processes and outcomes. However, I recognize that I experience nervousness with public speaking. 
 To overcome this, I have taken public speaking courses, sought feedback from mentors and peers, and practiced regularly.
 This ongoing effort is gradually boosting my confidence and helping me overcome my fear.
 In addition to my professional goals, I am deeply passionate about understanding personal finance and investments. 
 I believe financial knowledge can transform lives, and I stay updated on the latest trends, rules, and market conditions. 
 I continuously learn through reading and taking courses to deepen my understanding.</p>
